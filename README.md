# AutoML
AutoMl with Bayesian Optimization

In this project, we explored two approaches to Bayesian hyperparameter optimization for AutoML models: a custom implementation and an approach using Hyperopt. Both methods demonstrated the capability to efficiently search the hyperparameter space and improve model performance.
